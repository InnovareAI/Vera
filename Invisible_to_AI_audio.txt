For the past 20 years, we've all known the rules
for getting found online.
But well, everything's changing right now.
There's a massive shift happening
that could make all that hard work kind of pointless.
So let's dive into this brand new world
and figure out how to make sure you're still seen.
I really want to start with this question
because it kind of hits at the core of everything
we've been taught.
For as long as I can remember being number one on Google,
that was it.
That was the goal.
But what if that's not even the game we're playing anymore?
Welcome to what people are calling the post search era.
And this isn't some sci-fi movie concept.
It's here, right now.
Instead of scrolling through those classic 10 blue links,
users are just asking an AI a question
and getting a direct answer.
Now, here's the really crucial part.
If your website isn't the source for that answer,
you are for all intents and purposes invisible.
So what do we do?
How do we adapt?
Well, it really boils down to this.
Your website has to become bilingual.
It needs to keep speaking the old language of search engine
crawlers, you know, Google's bots.
But now, it also has to become fluent
in the brand new language of generative AI.
OK, so we all know SEO, search engine optimization.
That's the language of the crawlers
we've been speaking for years.
But now, we've got to get good at GEO, which
stands for generative engine optimization.
This is the language that AI assistants, like chat GPT,
actually understand and more importantly, trust.
They're two totally different things,
but both are absolutely critical now.
Let's just break that down a bit.
SEO, you know the drill.
It's all about keywords, getting backlinks,
making sure your site's technical structure is perfect.
It's all about climbing a ranked list.
GEO though, it's a whole different ballgame.
It's about giving clear conversational answers,
proving you're a real authority, and making your content
so good that an AI feels confident enough to actually cite it.
You know, here's a good way to think about it.
SEO was kind of like trying to game an old computer scanner.
You'd stuff your resume with keywords, hoping the machine
would pick them up.
But GEO, GEO is like writing a killer resume
for a sharp human hiring manager.
It's not about tricking a system.
It's about clearly and convincingly
communicating your value to an intelligent reader.
In this case, the AI.
OK, so how do we actually start speaking this new language?
I mean, how does an AI even decide
which content it should trust?
It all comes down to a specific set of signals.
So let's decode this and look at the key factors
that these generative engines use to figure out
if your content is, you know, AI ready.
All right, first things first.
The single most important thing you have to get
is that AI is our answer machines.
That is their whole reason for being.
They exist to give a user a direct answer.
So it should be no surprise that the number one thing
they look for is content that's structured
to do exactly that.
And what's really fascinating here
is that the AI's are literally trained
to find content that's written the way we talk.
They are actively scanning your pages
for these Q&A patterns, the what's the hows, the whys,
because it's a huge clue that your content is there
to provide a straight-up answer.
And believe me, this isn't just a minor tweak.
In the systems that analyze this stuff,
just having these Q&A patterns can be worth up to 20 points.
That's a huge chunk of your score.
It just goes to show how much these new engines value
content that's built from the ground up to be an answer.
Next up, an AI cannot afford to be wrong.
I mean, its entire reputation is on the line
with every answer it gives.
It has to ground its answers in reality.
So it's absolutely desperate to verify
that your content is coming from a real legitimate expert.
This is where those signals of experience, expertise,
authority, and trust, what we call EET,
become so important.
And the AI is not just guessing.
It's a machine, so it's looking for machine-readable clues.
Stuff like a super-clear, written-by line
with an author's name, credentials like CEO or PhD
right there in the text.
And of course, a solid about us page
that shows there are real qualified people behind the curtain.
And again, look at the points.
This is another heavily-weighted factor.
You can't just be an expert anymore.
You have to structure your website to prove you're an expert
in a way that a machine can easily read and tick off
its checklist.
So this next one is just common sense when you think about it.
Just like AI's want to be a trusted source,
they also trust content that sites other trusted sources.
When you link out to high-authority websites,
it's a massive signal that you've done your homework,
and your content is grounded in facts.
And we're not talking about linking to just any old blog
post.
The AI is specifically on the lookout
for citations to the big guns.
Think.gov and .edu websites.
Top to your publications like Forbes,
and major research firms like McKinsey or Gartner.
Linking to these guys is like a credibility shortcut.
When you back up your claims with hard data
and link out to these kinds of authoritative sources,
wow, that is a powerful one-two punch.
You're basically telling the AI, hey,
this isn't just my opinion.
This is well-researched factual information.
In a way, you're borrowing the authority of your sources,
which makes your own content that much more citable.
OK, so how do we actually pull all this together
into a real strategy?
The most important thing to remember
is that we're not throwing SEO out the window.
Not at all.
SEO is still the foundation of your house.
What we're doing is building a second story on top of it.
We're integrating Geo, so we're optimized
for the crawlers of today and the AIs of tomorrow.
And this chart here gives you a pretty clear target
to shoot for.
If you can get your Geo score into that good or even better,
excellent range, it means you're in a fantastic spot.
It means you're not just showing up in old school search.
You're also very, very likely to be picked up and cited
by AI.
So here it is, your four-step blueprint
for this new post-search world.
First, keep that SEO foundation strong.
Don't neglect it.
Second, start weaving in all these Geo signals
we've been talking about.
Third, actively think about structuring your content
so it can be a direct, citable answer.
And finally, number four, focus on building
what you could call dual authority,
where you're trusted by both Google spots and the AI models.
This quote just nails it, doesn't it?
The whole game is shifting.
It's moving away from just being discoverable in a long list
and toward becoming the definitive source
for a single correct answer.
That's the mindset we all need to have now.
And that's really what I want to leave you with.
It's not good enough anymore for your content
to just be findable with a few keywords.
In this post-search era, the only question that truly matters
is this one.
Is your content good enough, clear enough,
and trustworthy enough for an AI to cite it as the truth?
