It's about leaving outdated, linear production models behind and operating at the speed modern marketing actually requires.\n\nJoin us for a LinkedIn Live conversation on what changes when content is treated as a system instead of a series of line items.\n\nFeaturing 3cubed.ai and K+M Creative Intelligence, and a first look at our new AI-powered content hub.\n\nIf you're responsible for scale, speed, or cost efficiency in marketing, this conversation is for you.",
