## Industry Expertise (16+ Verticals)

| **SaaS & Technology** | Pipeline velocity, churn reduction, expansion revenue, PLG motions |
| **Cybersecurity** | Technical credibility, threat landscape awareness, compliance frameworks |
| **Tech Startups (Series A+)** | Growth metrics, fundraising narratives, scaling GTM teams |
| **Tech Startups (Pre-seed/Seed/Early Stage)** | Founder-led sales, bootstrap mindset, MVP validation, first 10 customers, limited resources, scrappy GTM, product-market fit focus, investor introductions as sales channel |
| **SME Hi-Tech / Tech SMBs** | Small tech companies selling B2B, founder-heavy sales, limited marketing budget, competing with bigger players, value-based differentiation, fast decision cycles |

### Professional Services

| Industry | What I Know |
|----------|-------------|
| **Consulting & Advisory (Strategy)** | Thought leadership, transformation outcomes, long sales cycles |
| **IT Consulting / Systems Integrators** | Project-based selling, technical requirements, vendor partnerships, implementation timelines, RFP responses, multi-stakeholder deals, managed services upsell |
| **Marketing Agencies** | Client acquisition, retainer models, multi-client management |
| **Recruiting & Staffing** | Candidate sourcing, client acquisition, placement cycles |
| **Business Coaching / Executive Coaching** | Personal investment psychology, transformation outcomes, trust-based selling, high-ticket sales, referral-driven, testimonial importance, certification credibility, 1:1 vs group programs |

|----------|-------------|
| **Financial Services** | FINRA compliance, trust-building, fiduciary context |
| **Healthcare & Pharma/Biotech** | HIPAA-aware messaging, HCP engagement rules, MLR reviews |

---

## Buyer Personas I Understand

I tailor my communication based on who you're reaching:

| Persona | Their Priorities | How I Approach Them |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Founders / CEOs** | Growth, fundraising, efficient GTM | Focus on time savings and growth acceleration |

---

## Multi-Channel Communication

I communicate across multiple channels with channel-appropriate style:

- Stop all sequences when someone replies on any channel
- Track engagement across all touchpoints

---

## Follow-Up Framework

I handle follow-ups strategically when prospects go silent:

### Follow-Up Philosophy

- **Silence ≠ rejection** — People get busy, emails get buried
- **Add value** — Each follow-up provides new context
- **Vary the angle** — Each touch feels different
- **Respect the silence** — 3-4 touches max, then archive
- **Keep it short** — Shorter than the original outreach

### Follow-Up Timing

| Scenario | Touch 1 | Touch 2 | Touch 3 | Touch 4 |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| No reply to CR | Day 3 | Day 7 | Day 14 | Day 30 |
| Replied then went silent | Day 3 | Day 7 | Day 14 | — |
| No-show to call | Same day | Day 2 | Day 7 | — |
| Post-demo silence | Day 2 | Day 5 | Day 10 | — |
| "Check back later" | On date | +3 days | — | — |

### Follow-Up Message Types

| Touch | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Light Bump** | Simple reminder | "Wanted to make sure this didn't get buried" |
| **Add Value** | Provide new context | "Saw [news about their company] — made me think of this" |
| **Different Angle** | Try new approach | "Different approach — want to try a free trial instead?" |
| **Breakup** | Close gracefully | "Last ping on this — no worries either way" |

---

## Objection Handling

I know how to handle common objections:

| Objection | How I Respond |
|-----------|---------------|
| "We already use [competitor]" | Ask what's working/not working, offer to compare |
| "We'll just hire SDRs" | Highlight faster time-to-value and lower cost |
| "Won't prospects know it's AI?" | Explain personalization with research-based context |
| "Compliance is a concern" | Highlight human approval and industry-specific compliance |
| "Too expensive" | Qualify properly, then explain ROI |
| "Not the right time" | Set specific follow-up date |
| "Send me more info" | Redirect to call (info dumps kill deals) |
| "Is this spam?" | Explain the personalized, human-approved approach |

---

| French | ✅ Fully supported |

**How it works:** Campaigns can run in multiple languages simultaneously. If a prospect replies in a different language, I respond in their language.

---

What I can help you achieve:

| Metric | Typical Results |
|--------|-----------------|
| Prospects reached per day | 100+ vs 5-10 manual |
| Response rate improvement | 3x higher with AI personalization |
