**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: January 4, 2026

## How SAM Uses This

When a prospect raises an objection, SAM:

1. Identifies the industry context
2. Applies the appropriate response framework
3. Adapts the language to their vertical
4. Moves toward next steps

---

## Universal Objection Framework

### The LAER Model

1. **Listen** - Let them finish, acknowledge
2. **Acknowledge** - Show you understand their concern
3. **Explore** - Ask clarifying questions
4. **Respond** - Address with relevant proof

---

## SaaS / Technology

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "We already use [competitor]" | "What's working? What's not? Many clients run us alongside initially to compare results." |
| "We'll build it in-house" | "Totally get that. What's the opportunity cost of your engineering team building vs. buying?" |
| "Too expensive" | "What's the cost of the problem staying unsolved? Let's calculate the ROI." |
| "We're not ready" | "What would need to happen to be ready? Can I check back in [timeframe]?" |
| "Need to involve more stakeholders" | "Happy to help with that. What would be most useful - a deck, ROI calculator, or a group demo?" |

---

## Business Coaching / Executive Coaching

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "I can't measure ROI on coaching" | "Let's define success upfront. What would make this investment feel like a win in 6 months?" |
| "I've tried coaching before" | "What was different about that experience? What would you need to see to give this a shot?" |
| "Too expensive" | "What's the cost of staying where you are for another year? Let's look at the math." |
| "I don't have time" | "What's taking up your time right now? Often that's exactly what coaching helps unlock." |
| "I can figure this out myself" | "You probably can. But how long will it take? Coaching collapses timelines." |

---

## Tech Startups (Pre-seed / Seed)

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "We don't have budget" | "What would move the needle most for you right now? Let's see if there's a scrappy way to start." |
| "We're too early" | "Some of our best results are with early teams who build habits from day one. What's your current approach?" |
| "Founder does all the sales" | "That's totally normal. How's that scaling? What would free up your time for product?" |
| "We'll do this after funding" | "Makes sense. What if you could show investors better pipeline metrics before the raise?" |
| "Not a priority right now" | "What is the priority? If it's revenue, this might be more related than you think." |

---

## IT Consulting / Systems Integrators

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "We respond to RFPs, don't proactively sell" | "What if you could get in front of opportunities before they go to RFP? Win rates are 3x higher pre-RFP." |
| "Our partners bring us leads" | "How consistent is that? What would happen if you had your own pipeline alongside partner deals?" |
| "Long sales cycles, automation won't help" | "Automation handles the top of funnel so your team focuses on the complex deals." |
| "We're relationship-based" | "Exactly — automation helps you have more relationships at scale." |
| "Need technical resources, not sales help" | "Would it help if your best people spent less time on lead gen and more on delivery?" |

---

## SME Manufacturing

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "We get all our business from referrals" | "That's great — and unpredictable. What if you could add a consistent pipeline on top of referrals?" |
| "We're too busy to take on more work" | "What if you could pick and choose the best-fit customers instead of taking everything?" |
| "Technology doesn't work for our industry" | "I hear that a lot. Want to see how [similar company] thought the same thing and got X results?" |
| "Owner makes all the sales decisions" | "Totally. How much time would it save if the groundwork was done before you get involved?" |
| "We've been doing it this way for 30 years" | "And it's worked. The question is whether the next 10 years look like the last 30." |

---

## SME Hi-Tech / Tech SMBs

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "We can't compete with enterprise vendors" | "You don't have to. You compete on speed, service, and specialization. Let's amplify that." |
| "We don't have a marketing team" | "That's exactly why automation helps — it's like having a team without the overhead." |
| "Founder is too involved in sales" | "Common at your stage. The question is how to scale without adding headcount." |
| "We need to focus on product" | "Agreed. What if sales happened in the background while you build?" |
| "Not sure it'll work for us" | "Fair. What would you need to see to feel confident? Can we test it?" |

---

## Healthcare / Life Sciences

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Compliance is too risky" | "We're designed for regulated industries. Human approval on every message, audit trails, HIPAA-aware." |
| "Long procurement cycles" | "We help you stay top of mind during those 12-18 month cycles without manual effort." |
| "Need to involve legal/compliance" | "Happy to provide documentation. What would they need to see?" |
| "We sell to health systems, they're different" | "Exactly why personalization matters. Generic outreach doesn't work with HCPs." |
| "Already working with [competitor]" | "What's working? Where are the gaps? Many clients layer us alongside existing tools." |

---

## Financial Services

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Compliance won't approve" | "We work with [X similar firms]. Human-in-the-loop, audit trails, pre-approved templates." |
| "Our clients expect personal touch" | "Absolutely. We augment, not replace. Your team still owns the relationship." |
| "Fiduciary concerns" | "Understood. That's why every message is reviewed before sending. You maintain control." |
| "We're relationship-driven, not transactional" | "This helps you have more relationships, not fewer. Automation handles the mundane." |
| "Already have enough clients" | "What about referrals? Or reaching more of your ideal client profile?" |

---

## Recruiting / Staffing

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "We use job boards and InMails" | "How's the response rate? Personalized outreach typically 3-5x higher than InMails." |
| "Candidates don't respond to automation" | "They don't respond to template blasts. They do respond to personalized, research-based outreach." |
| "We're too niche" | "Niche is perfect for automation — hyper-targeted, industry-specific messaging." |
| "Already have recruiters" | "How much time do they spend sourcing vs. talking to candidates? Let's flip that ratio." |
| "Tight margins, can't add cost" | "What if this reduced your cost per placement? Let's look at the numbers." |

---

## Professional Services / Consulting

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Our work is referral-based" | "Great. What if you could add predictable pipeline alongside referrals?" |
| "Partners don't have time for BD" | "That's the point. Automation does the prospecting so partners only take qualified meetings." |
| "We're too specialized" | "Specialization is a strength. Targeted outreach works better than broad spray." |
| "Big 4 wins on brand" | "You win on relationships and specialization. Let's amplify that advantage." |
| "Long sales cycles, doesn't fit" | "We help you nurture those 18-month relationships without manual effort." |

---

## Agency / Marketing Services

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "We do this for clients, not ourselves" | "The cobbler's children, right? What if client acquisition ran in the background?" |
| "Margins are too tight" | "What's your CAC right now? Automation can cut that significantly." |
| "We're too busy with client work" | "Exactly. Automated BD means you're not choosing between delivery and sales." |
| "Rely on referrals and inbound" | "What's the quality of inbound? Outbound lets you pick your ideal clients." |
| "Already have a sales process" | "How's it performing? What if we could add 20% more pipeline with less effort?" |

---

## Real Estate / PropTech

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Market is too uncertain" | "Uncertain markets are when relationships matter most. Stay top of mind for when things turn." |
| "We're relationship-driven" | "Automation helps you maintain more relationships consistently." |
| "Clients expect personal service" | "Agreed. Automation handles the prospecting so you can focus on service." |
| "Just need to wait for the market" | "What if you could build pipeline now so you're first when things pick up?" |
| "Different in our market" | "Every market says that. What specifically would you need to see to believe it works here?" |

---

## E-commerce / Retail

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "We're B2C, not B2B" | "But you work with vendors, wholesalers, retail partners — all B2B relationships." |
| "Marketing handles our outreach" | "For customer acquisition. What about partnerships, wholesale, D2C partnerships?" |
| "Budget is tied up in paid media" | "What's your CAC on paid? B2B partnerships often have better unit economics." |
| "Too focused on operations" | "What if new partnerships ran in the background while you focus on ops?" |
| "Already have retail relationships" | "How'd you get those? Imagine scaling that systematically." |

---

## Legal / LegalTech

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Bar rules restrict marketing" | "We're aware of the rules. Thought leadership and relationship-building are compliant approaches." |
| "Partners generate their own business" | "How consistent is that? What about developing the next generation of rainmakers?" |
| "Clients come through referrals" | "Great. What's the pipeline look like 2 years out? Referrals + outreach is more predictable." |
| "We're a specialized boutique" | "Specialization is your advantage. Targeted outreach amplifies that." |
| "Takes too long to build trust" | "Automation handles the volume. Your team handles the trust-building." |

---

## Cybersecurity

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "We sell through channel partners" | "What about the end customers? Building awareness before they go to channel helps partners win." |
| "It's a technical sale, not marketing" | "Technical buyers still need to hear from you. We help you get in front of them." |
| "Security buyers are skeptical" | "Exactly. That's why personalized, research-based outreach works better than spray-and-pray." |
| "Long enterprise cycles" | "We help you stay top of mind during those 12-18 month evaluations." |
| "Already working with [competitor]" | "What's working? What's not? Many teams layer approaches." |

## Overcoming "I'll Think About It"

This is the most common non-objection. It usually means:

- They don't see enough value
- They have an objection they didn't share
- They're not the decision maker

**Response**: "Totally fair. Can I ask — is there something specific you're weighing, or something I could clarify that would help?"

---

## Overcoming "Send Me Information"

Usually a polite brush-off. Don't just send a PDF.

**Response**: "Happy to. To make sure I send the right info — what specifically would be most useful? And is there anyone else who should be on this?"

---

## Overcoming "Call Me Next Quarter"

Timing objection. Get specific.

**Response**: "Absolutely. What happens next quarter that changes things? And would it help to stay in touch with relevant insights in the meantime?"
