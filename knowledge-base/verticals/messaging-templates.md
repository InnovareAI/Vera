## How SAM Uses Templates

SAM adapts these templates based on:

1. Industry-specific language and pain points
2. Buyer persona (CEO, VP, Manager)
3. Channel (LinkedIn CR, LinkedIn DM, Email)
4. Stage in sequence (first touch, follow-up, breakup)

---

## Template Structure

Each industry section includes:

- **Connection Request** (under 300 chars)
- **First Message** (after accept)
- **Follow-up 1** (Day 3)
- **Follow-up 2** (Day 7)
- **Breakup** (Day 14)

Variables: `{first_name}`, `{company}`, `{title}`, `{industry}`, `{mutual_connections}`

## SaaS / Technology

### Connection Request

```
Hi {first_name}, noticed you're scaling {company}'s GTM. 
Would love to connect — we help SaaS teams fill pipeline without adding headcount.
```

### First Message (After Accept)

```
Thanks for connecting, {first_name}! 

Quick q: how's your team handling outbound right now — in-house SDRs, outsourced, or founder-led?

Always curious how high-growth SaaS teams approach it.
```

### Follow-up 1 (Day 3)

```
Following up — saw {company}'s recent news. Congrats!

BTW, we've been helping SaaS teams like yours book 30-40% more meetings 
without hiring. Would that be relevant?
```

### Follow-up 2 (Day 7)

```
Last thought: we put together a short playbook on scaling outbound 
for SaaS teams. Happy to share if helpful — no pitch, just insights.
```

### Breakup (Day 14)

```
Closing the loop — sounds like timing isn't right. 
Totally understand. I'll circle back in a few months. 🤙
```

## Business Coaching / Executive Coaching

### Connection Request

```
Hi {first_name}, saw your work in executive coaching. 
Would love to connect — we help coaches build consistent client pipelines.
```

### First Message

```
Thanks for connecting! 

Out of curiosity — how are you currently acquiring new clients? 
Mostly referrals, or do you have an outbound motion?
```

### Follow-up 1

```
Following up — I know most coaches rely on referrals, which works 
until it doesn't. We help coaches add predictable pipeline on top. 

Worth a 15-min chat to see if relevant?
```

### Follow-up 2

```
One more thought: we've helped coaches go from 2-3 discovery calls/month 
to 10+. Would that kind of result move the needle for you?
```

### Breakup

```
Seems like timing isn't right — no worries at all. 
Keep crushing it, and I'll check back in a few months.
```

## Tech Startups (Pre-seed / Seed)

### Connection Request

```
Hi {first_name}, building {company} looks exciting! 
Love connecting with founders tackling the sales puzzle early.
```

### First Message

```
Thanks for the connect! 

Quick q: how are you handling sales right now — 
founder-led, or starting to think about scaling?
```

### Follow-up 1

```
Most founders I talk to are doing all the sales themselves. 
Works until it doesn't scale. We help founders get that time back 
while still building pipeline. Relevant?
```

### Follow-up 2

```
Last thought — we helped a pre-seed founder go from 5 to 50 customers 
without hiring an SDR. Happy to share how if you're curious.
```

### Breakup

```
Sounds like you've got your hands full building. Totally get it. 
I'll check back in a quarter when things settle. Good luck! 🚀

## IT Consulting / Systems Integrators

### Connection Request

```
Hi {first_name}, saw {company}'s work in IT consulting. 
Would love to connect — we help SIs build pipeline beyond partner referrals.
```

### First Message

Thanks for connecting! 

Quick question: is your pipeline mostly partner-driven, 
or do you have a direct outreach motion?
```

### Follow-up 1

```
Following up — most SIs I talk to are 70-80% partner-dependent. 
We help them build direct pipeline alongside that. Would that be useful?
```

### Follow-up 2

```
One thing I've seen work well: getting in front of IT directors 
before projects go to RFP. Win rates 3x higher pre-bid. 
Want to compare notes?
```

### Breakup

```
Closing the loop here. Sounds like partner pipeline is working. 
If that ever feels shaky, I'm around. Cheers!
```

with a fraction of the budget. We help level the playing field.

We help flip that ratio. Would that be useful?
```

### Follow-up 2

```
We helped one search firm increase placements per recruiter by 50% 
just by freeing up more talk time. Would that move the needle?
